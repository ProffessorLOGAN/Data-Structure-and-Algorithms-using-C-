    // The bitwise complement operator is a unary operator (works on only one operand). It is denoted by ~ that changes binary digits 1 to 0 and 0 to 1.

    // Bitwise Complement operation in C++
    // Bitwise Complement
    // It is important to note that the bitwise complement of any integer N is equal to -(N + 1). For example,

    // Consider an integer 35. As per the rule, the bitwise complement of 35 should be -(35 + 1) = -36. Now, let's see if we get the correct answer or not.

    // 35 = 00100011 (In Binary)

    // // Using bitwise complement operator
    // ~ 00100011
    //  __________
    //   11011100
    // In the above example, we get that the bitwise complement of 00100011 (35) is 11011100. Here, if we convert the result into decimal we get 220.

    // However, it is important to note that we cannot directly convert the result into decimal and get the desired output. This is because the binary result 11011100 is also equivalent to -36.

    // To understand this we first need to calculate the binary output of -36. We use 2's complement to calculate the binary of negative integers.

    // 2's Complement
    // The 2's complement of a number N gives -N.

    // In binary arithmetic, 1's complement changes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

    // And, if we add 1 to the result of the 1's complement, we get the 2's complement of the original number.

    // For example,

    // 36 = 00100100 (In Binary)

    // 1's Complement = 11011011

    // 2's Complement :
    // 11011011
    //  +     1
    // _________
    // 11011100
    // Here, we can see the 2's complement of 36 (i.e. -36) is 11011100. This value is equivalent to the bitwise complement of 35 that we have calculated in the previous section.

    // Hence, we can say that the bitwise complement of 35 = -36.

    // Output

    // ~(35) = -36
    // ~(-150) = 149
    // In the above example, we declared two integer variables num1 and num2, and initialized them with the values of 35 and -150 respectively.

    // We then computed their bitwise complement with the codes (~num1) and (~num2) respectively and displayed them on the screen.

    // The bitwise complement of 35 = - (35 + 1) = -36
    // i.e. ~35 = -36

    // The bitwise complement of -150 = - (-150 + 1) = - (-149) = 149
    // i.e. ~(-150) = 149

    
    int num1 = 35;
    int num2 = -150;
    cout << "~(" << num1 << ") = " << (~num1) << endl;
    cout << "~(" << num2 << ") = " << (~num2) << endl;
